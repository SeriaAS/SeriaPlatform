SERIA_Counter is HIGHLY optimized for performance. There should be almost no performance penalties in using SERIA_Counter
for generating great statistics for your users. The performance is achieved by a few methods:

1. Updates are batched together and executed in the destructor of the last instance.
2. Updates are sent to a memory based mysql-table.
3. Fetches are sent to both the memory table and the persistent table.
4. The memory table is commited to the persistent table on maintenance.

The risk is losing statistics when the database server is restarted
