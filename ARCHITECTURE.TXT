Seria Platform is an "operating system" for PHP web applications. Seria Platform attempts to make the environment
predictable by abstracting away special quirks introduced by certain PHP configurations, and make tools available
for the following:

- Caching
- Authentication
- Hooks and listeners
- Database abstraction
- Templates
- Translation
- RPC

Key architecture elements:

Webroot application
-------------------
The webroot application is code for the main purpose of the installation. It consists of the following files:

/seria		The Seria Platform framework
/seria.php	An optional PHP file that is included on every page view, also in administration view. For
		hooking into core hooks.
/classes	An optional folder for custom class files.
/files		The default location for user uploaded files.

Platform applications
---------------------
Any installation of Seria Platform carries applications. Applications in this context are meant to service common
needs for any Webroot application. If the webroot application is a webshop, it can utilize applications such as a
e-mail newsletter application, a CRM application and of course the normal Control Panel application.

Platform applications are located in the /seria/apps folder. Each app has an application.php that is included on every
page view.

Examples:
- Seria Control Panel, an application for centralizing control over all user configurable functionable options and user
management.
- Seria Business, a registry of companies, contacts, payments etc.
- Seria Mobile, an application helping with identifying mobile phones and supporting them trough a simplified template 
system. Used when the webroot application has another purpose. The webroot application can then use the Seria Mobile 
application to provide a mobile version of itself.
- Seria EsiFrontend; an esi parser that intercepts unhandled urls on the webroot and forwards them to another website.
- Seria Content Management; an application for managing a content repository, workflow and publishing process that can 
be used by any application.
- Seria Mailing List, an application for sending mass e-mails and handling 


Platform components
-------------------
Any installation of Seria Platform consists of the core framework and support components. Support components are
located in the /seria/components folder. Each component has a component.php that is included on every page view.

Examples:
- Service Providers. Any service that has custom API's in Seria Platform, such as handling payment by VISA and similar
can be supported by creating a service provider. For example the SERIA_PaymentService could be extended by PayPal
Payment Service.
