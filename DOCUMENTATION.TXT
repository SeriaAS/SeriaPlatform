Documentation in Seria Platform is extremely lacking. All classes should be documented using phpDocumentor:
http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.pkg.html

Audience of your documentation: Other developers, both developers of applications and developers of the simplest
websites. Ofcourse this depends on what you are developing; if you are developing an API for RPC communication
your audience is more technical.

Generally, documentation of a class need both a functional specification of the class, atleast one example of
usage and explanation of all public and protected class methods.
